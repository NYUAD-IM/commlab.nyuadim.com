				<div class='title'>Course Description</div>
				<div class='medium'>Communications Lab is a production based course that surveys various technologies including web development, sound, 2D design, digital imaging, video, effects and animation. The forms and uses of these communications technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation, collaboration, and discussion. Much of class time will be spent introducing and playing with equipment and software essential to media production and contemporary storytelling. Each technology is examined as a tool that can be employed and utilized in a variety of situations and experiences. Students will gain fundamental experience thinking, writing, and producing across a variety of media. The world wide web will serve as the primary environment for content delivery and user-interaction. Principles of interpersonal communications and media theory are also introduced with an emphasis on storytelling fundamentals, user-­centered design, and interactivity. Outside of the classroom, students will work both individually and in assigned groups on a variety of assignments. Each major assignment will have a written and practical component. In sum, students will be expected to complete weekly readings, homework exercises, four major group assignments, and one final web portfolio project.</div>

				<div class='title'>Teaching Methodology</div>
				<div class='medium'>This course takes a project-based active learning approach with the intention of providing students with as much hands ­on experience as possible. Classes move quickly through each technology, first providing a theoretical foundation along with technical instruction, and then encouraging students to learn through play, experimentation, collaboration, and exploration. Individual classes will include lectures, discussions, examples, workshops, group work, and presentations. Outside of the class, students will engage in both individual and group work. Group collaboration is a fundamental component of this course. The overall intention is not mastery in any one domain, but meaningful and tangible exposure to a range of processes, technologies, and media.</div>

				<ul class='medium'>
					<li>Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the preceding one so it is vital to be present and on time for every lesson. </li>
					<li>Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact both your final grade for the class and your attendance grade. If you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.</li>
					<li>More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in your attendance grade per absence. The attendance grade starts at 97. After four unexcused absences, you will fail the class.</li>
					<li>After four unexcused absences, you will fail the class.</li>
					<li>Technical Workshop attendance is absolutely mandatory. If you miss a technical workshop, you will not be allowed to use or check-out equipment. There are no exceptions to this.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class='main-section'>
				<div class='title'>Participation</div>
				<ul class='medium'>
					<li>Engaging in class discussions and offering advice, input, feedback, etc during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress. What is equally important is that it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to learn from each other through the sharing of failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.</li>
					<li>All assignments must be turned in on time.</li>
					<li>Be prepared to work in groups on the assignments</li>
					<li>You are expected to present your work in class. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.</li>
					<li>Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.</li>
