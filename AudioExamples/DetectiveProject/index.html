		<h2>Case Solved</h2>
		<p>
 			A while ago, when the old blind man suffered the ship accident, the lifeboat crew  wrecked along to  a desert island. There, before starving, the survivors gave him gull to eat. When he tasted the gull in the restaurant, he noticed a huge difference in taste with the gull  they gave him in the shipwreck. So, he remembered that his wife  had been the only that did not make it alive and he ate that "gull" just a few hours after she died. Hence, he realized it was not seagull what he ate in the island, but his wife.
